Exception: An Exception is an runtime error which can be handled by the programmer.
All Exceptions are represented as classes in python.

Types of Exceptions:
1)Built-in Exception - Exceptions which are already predefined.(available in Python Language.)
                        The Base class for all Built-in Exceptions is BaseException class.

Exception Handling
Try - The try block contains code which may cause exceptions.
Syntax-try:
statements
Except - The except block is used to catch an exception that is raised in the try block.
There can be multiple except block for try block.
Syntax-except ExceptionName:
statements


We can write several except blocks for a single try block.
• We can write multiple except blocks to handle multiple exceptions.
• We can write try block without any except blocks.
• We can not write except block without a try block.
• Finally block is always executed irrespective of whether there is an exception or not.
• Else block is optional.
• Finally block is optional.
